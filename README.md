## 🔐 Cybersecurity Journey

My journey began with curiosity-driven exploration in **ethical hacking and bug bounty hunting**. But over time, I found greater purpose and drive in **defensive security**—investigating logs, detecting threats, and building resilient environments.

That shift inspired me to build full-fledged labs, troubleshoot real-world scenarios, and take control of my own learning path. I believe **real skills come from doing**, and I’m committed to learning by building, breaking, and securing.
